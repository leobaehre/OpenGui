  * `id` - Put here the ID of the GUI you want to open
* `opengui <reload>` - Reloads the plugin
  * `reload` - Reload the plugin

## Configuration

This plugin is build to be configurable. Almost every string that can be seen by a player has support for color codes. For the list of color codes, please see [this page](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php). ยง is replaced with &. so its easier to type. For example, red would be &c.

### Setting up a GUI
To set up a GUI, you need to create a new file in the `guis` folder. The file should be in YAML format. The following is an example of a GUI file:
```yaml
id: 'example' # The ID of the GUI
title: 'Some Title' # The title of the GUI
size: 27 # The size of the GUI (must be a multiple of 9 e.g. 9 or 27)
items: # The items in the GUI
  item1: # This doesn't matter, it's just a name
    slot: 0 # The slot of the item
    material: DIAMOND_SWORD # The material of the item
    display-name: '&cSpecial Sword' # The display name of the item
    lore: # The lore of the item
      - '&fLine 1' 
      - '&fLine 2'
    actions: # The actions of the item. The different types of actions are later explained
      - type: close
      - type: command
        command: say Hello World!
```

## Items
Items work are a bit more restrictive than the normal spigot items you may be used to. There are currently a limited properties than can be set (more will be added in the future). The following are the properties of an item:
* `Slot`: The slot of the item
* `Material`: The material of the item
* `Display Name`: The display name of the item
* `Lore`: The lore of the item each item in the list is a new line
* `Actions`: The actions of the items

## Actions
Actions are what happens when a player clicks on an item in a GUI. The following are the different types of actions:

### Close
This action closes the GUI after clicked on the item.   

#### Data
This action has no data.

#### Example
```yaml
actions:
  - type: close
```
In this example, the GUI will be closed when the item is clicked.

### Open
This action opens another GUI after clicked on the item.

#### Data
* `ID`: The ID of the GUI to open

#### Example
```yaml
actions:
  - type: open
    id: example
```
In this example, the GUI with the ID `example` will be opened when the item is clicked.

### Command
This action runs a command after clicked on the item.

#### Data
* `Command`: The command to run

#### Example
```yaml
actions:
  - type: command
    command: say Hello World!
```
In this example, the command `say Hello World!` will be run when the item is clicked.

### Conversation
This action starts a conversation after clicked on the item. If the player is in a conversation then the player can chat a message to input. This input can then be used.

#### Data
* `Question`: The question to ask the player

#### Example
```yaml
  actions:
    - type: close # Optional please see the explanation for the example below
    - type: conversation
      question: "Do you like sushi?"
      answers:
        - answer: "Yes"
          actions:
            - type: command
              command: give %player% minecraft:cod 1
        - answer: "No"
          actions:
            - type: command
              command: "say Well that sucks :("
      other-answer:
        type: command
        command: "This is not a valid answer!"
```
In this example, the player will be asked the question `Do you like sushi?`. If the player answers `Yes` then the player will be given a cod. If the player answers `No` then the player will be told `Well that sucks :(`. If the player answers anything else then the player will be told `This is not a valid answer!`. I recommend putting the action `close` GUI is closed when the conversation starts.
